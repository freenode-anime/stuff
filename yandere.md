# Yandere

*“A yandere game is starting in 60 seconds! Please type "]y end" to prevent this from happening.“*

Yandere is a game that ljrbot does. It's basically mafia/werewolf but with over nine thousand different roles that no one can remember. An average game consists of a series of days and nights. On the first day the goodies usually lynch some innocent fellow at random. During the night the yandere target(s) someone who possibly dies as a result. The next day everyone is pretty much as clueless as in the beginning, which doesn't really matter because at this point probably half of players have insidiously turned evil and the game is practically over. Unless there's a baka ranger who doesn't really care, or a null carrier who suddenly kills everyone for the sheer lulz of it.

If there is an active discussion in the channel, please play in #Yandere instead.

You usually get over it. For a chronic addiction we recommend other hobbies such as patching KDE2 under FreeBSD or Uno.
